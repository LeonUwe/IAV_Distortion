# Configuration File
There are a bunch of parameters that can be configured in the [config_file.json](../../src/config_file.json).
The config_file.json is a json file that includes all configurable parameters for IAV-Distortion.
The json is structured according to different main topics which include the corresponding parameters.
These parameters will be described in the following.
